# reactive-test
This project was created for edu purposes. I was testing **reactive possibilities** via working with **networking**.
## How to run
1. Run the project
2. Build all scenes (first scene in **BuildSettings** should be scene called **"Boot"**)
3. Ð¡reate two instances of the build (for example: **Command + D** on Mac) and run each one separately
4. First of all, on the first instance of a build click **start server** button and **after that** go to the next one and tap on the **start client**
5. Click everything you can on client-side
6. Enjoy ;)
